Hey! I'm Bradley and I'm currently learning how to be a Data Scientist.  Definitley need advice and tips on how to enter this new career path.  Just got laid off not too long ago from a company I worked with for 10 years.
Looking forward to interacting with people and getting connected in this new industry!

Thanks!
